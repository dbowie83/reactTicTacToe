Here I will be following the React tutorial as appears here:
https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe#

To run the app: 
1) clone the repository
2) cd into the reactTicTacToe repo you just cloned
3) run "npm install" to install dependencies
4) run "npm start" to run the app
5) navigate to "localhost:3000" in a web browser
